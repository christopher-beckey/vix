- Unzip "Built on x64 platform.zip" on a x64 Visual Studio 2008 development system
- Unzip "Built on x86 platform.zip" on a x86 system with jdk 1.6.30 installed. Java code is platform independent so it can be built on a x86 system or a x64 system. Note that the rt.jar files associated with java are platform specific due to non-java dependencies.

Follow the instruction in the following top level readme files:
 - .\Built on x64 platform\readme.txt
