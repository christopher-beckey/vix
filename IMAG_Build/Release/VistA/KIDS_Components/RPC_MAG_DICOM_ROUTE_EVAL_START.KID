Start one rule evaluator to evaluate the newly acquired
"KRN",8994,1751,1,17,0)
images for one specific location.
"KRN",8994,1751,1,18,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,1,19,0)
The rule-evaluators will run on the VistA system. They will be
"KRN",8994,1751,1,20,0)
started and stopped, however, from the DICOM Gateways.

The value of this parameter is a pointer to ^DIC(4).
"KRN",8994,1751,2,1,1,2,0)
This pointer identifies the location at which images were acquired.

"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,1,0)
The value of this parameter is an array (one integer subscript).
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,2,0)
This array contains the routing rules. Each element of this
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,3,0)
array represents one part of a rule; the strings in these elements
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,4,0)
each contain a number of fields, separated by carets ("^").
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,5,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,6,0)
In all rule-elements, the first caret-piece is the rule-number.
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,7,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,8,0)
The second piece is equal to either "ACTION", "CONDITION"
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,9,0)
or "PRIORITY".
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,10,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,11,0)
When the second piece is equal to "ACTION", there may be one or more
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,12,0)
additional pieces. If there is only an additional third piece,
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,13,0)
this piece represents the action-verb ("SEND" or "BALANCE"
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,14,0)
currently).
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,15,0)
When there are four or more pieces, the third piece represents
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,16,0)
the sequence number of the command-parameter, and the additional
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,17,0)
pieces represent the command-specific parameters.
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,18,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,19,0)
When the second piece is equal to "PRIORITY", the third piece
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,20,0)
will indicate the relative priority. Typical values are "LOW",
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,21,0)
"MEDIUM" and "HIGH".
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,22,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,23,0)
When the second piece is equal to "CONDITION", there are either
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,24,0)
five or seven pieces in total. 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,25,0)
In that case, the third piece always represents the sequence number
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,26,0)
of the current condition for the current rule.
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,27,0)
When there are five pieces,
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,28,0)
the fourth and fifth are a keyword=value pair and describe
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,29,0)
the nature of the condition. Valid keywords are "KW" (keyword),
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,30,0)
"DT" (data-type), "OP" (operator) and "VA" (value).
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,31,0)
A sequence of seven pieces only occurs when the data-type is
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,32,0)
equal to DT (Date/Time). When there are seven pieces, the fourth
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,33,0)
piece is always equal to "VA" (value) and the fifth through seventh
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,34,0)
pieces indicate a possible date/time range that applies for the
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,35,0)
condition.
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,36,0)
 
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,37,0)
Note that conditions are always ANDed with one another, and
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,38,0)
the multiple date/time ranges for a date/time value are always
"KRN",8994,1751,2,2,1,39,0)
ORed with one another.
