"KRN",8994,2084,1,4,0)
The Key Validator extrinsic function verifies that new values contained 
"KRN",8994,2084,1,5,0)
in the FDA do not produce an invalid key. All keys in which any field in 
"KRN",8994,2084,1,6,0)
the FDA participates are checked. If the value for a field in a key being 
"KRN",8994,2084,1,7,0)
checked is not present in the FDA, the value used to verify the key is 
"KRN",8994,2084,1,8,0)
obtained from the previously filed data.

The root of the FDA that contains the data to be checked. The array can

The value of fields in the FDA must be the internal value. Do not pass

external (e.g., unresolved pointer values, non-FileMan dates) in the FDA.

No action is taken on fields in the referenced FDA if those fields do not
