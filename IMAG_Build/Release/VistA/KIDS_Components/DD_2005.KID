The object group is a multiple field pointing back to the Image file
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,2,0)
(2005).  Only objects with an object type of GROUP have the Object Group
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,3,0)
field defined.  These objects can be thought of as the "parent" of a set
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,4,0)
of images.  
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,5,0)
 
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,6,0)
Generally, instead of having their own abstract, objects of the GROUP type
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,7,0)
use the abstract of the first entry in their object group multiple.  
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,8,0)
Sometimes, text will be used in place of the GROUP abstract for speed.  
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,9,0)
Methods for viewing a GROUP object generally allow viewing of all the
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,10,0)
members of the group, either selectively or altogether.  A good example
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,11,0)
would be a set of thirty CT scan images.  Using the Integrated View menu
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,12,0)
option, the tiled display of image abstracts would contain only one
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,13,0)
abstract for the group.  Selecting the group object for viewing provides
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,14,0)
the user with a tiled display of the abstracts of the individual CT scan
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,15,0)
images.  The user can then identify individual images for full resolution
"^DD",2005,2005,4,21,16,0)
