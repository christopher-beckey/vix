This field is a pointer to the Object Type file (2005.02) which defines
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,3,21,2,0)
the object type of this object, e.g. still image, black & white image,
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,3,21,3,0)
X-ray etc. The image type determines how various actions are performed i.e.
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,3,21,4,0)
how the full resolution image is displayed, or how and when the image
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,3,21,5,0)

The object group is a multiple field pointing back to the Image file
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,2,0)
(2005.1).  Only objects with an object type of GROUP have the object group
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,3,0)
field defined.  These objects can be thought of as the 'parent' of a set
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,4,0)
of images.  Generally, instead of having their own abstract, objects of
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,5,0)
the GROUP type use the abstract of the first entry in their object group
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,6,0)
multiple.  Sometimes, text will be used in place of the GROUP abstract for
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,7,0)
speed.  Methods for viewing a GROUP object generally allow viewing of all
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,8,0)
the members of the group, either selectively or altogether.  A good
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,9,0)
example would be a set of thirty CT scan images.  Using the integrated
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,10,0)
view menu option, the tiled display of image abstracts would contain only
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,11,0)
one abstract for the group.  Selecting the group object for viewing
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,12,0)
provides the user with a tiled display of the abstracts of the individual
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,13,0)
CT scan images.  The user can then identify individual images for full
"^DD",2005.1,2005.1,4,21,14,0)
resolution viewing.

The object group is a multiple field pointing back to the Image file
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,2,0)
(2005.1).  Only objects with an object type of GROUP have the object group
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,3,0)
field defined.  These objects can be thought of as the 'parent' of a set
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,4,0)
of images.  Generally, instead of having their own abstract, objects of
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,5,0)
the GROUP type use the abstract of the first entry in their object group
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,6,0)
multiple.  Sometimes, text will be used in place of the GROUP abstract for
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,7,0)
speed.  Methods for viewing a GROUP object generally allow viewing of all
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,8,0)
the members of the group, either selectively or altogether.  A good
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,9,0)
example would be a set of thirty CT scan images.  Using the integrated
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,10,0)
view menu option, the tiled display of image abstracts would contain only
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,11,0)
one abstract for the group.  Selecting the group object for viewing
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,12,0)
provides the user with a tiled display of the abstracts of the individual
"^DD",2005.1,2005.14,.01,21,13,0)
CT scan images.  The user can then identify individual images for full

place, the image is deleted on the server if it is there, the Parent Report

file's pointer to the image file is deleted, the data from the Image file
