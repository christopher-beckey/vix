<h1>Features - VistA Imaging Version 3.0</h1>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; "><font size=4 style="font-size:14pt;"><B>Summary</B></font></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt; "><font size=3 style="font-size:12pt;"><B>&nbsp;</B></font></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs3"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Introduction</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs4">VistA Imaging version 3.0 Display 
 and Capture incorporate many new features.</p>

<p class="whs4">In addition:</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">VistARad, the 
 diagnostic radiology workstation software, has been added.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">A number of 
 DICOM Gateway modifications have been included.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Data Integrity Checking</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs4">Vista Imaging 3.0 incorporates 
 data integrity checking tools that will detect and report the following 
 types of inconsistencies:</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">Image and associated 
 report are associated with different patients.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">Image is associated 
 with a report that is not associated with this image (or with any image).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">Report is associated 
 with an image that is not associated with this report (or with any report).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">The group’s 
 image information and the image’s group information do not agree.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">An image in 
 a group belongs to a different patient from the patient associated with 
 that group.</p></li>
	
	<ul type="square" class="whs6">
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">The associated 
 report for an image does not exist.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Users of the Display software will 
 be alerted when images fail the internal integrity checks.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">If an inconsistency 
 is detected, the user will not be able to open the suspect image or its 
 associated report.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">User alerts 
 include information that describes the discrepancy detected.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Data integrity checking has been 
 included in the final step of the capture process.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">If a discrepancy 
 is detected between the selected patient and the report to be associated 
 with the image, the images will be captured, but no association will be 
 made to the report.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">The images 
 will be viewable from within VistA Imaging, but they will not appear in 
 CPRS with the report.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">The user will 
 be informed that there are consistency problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">IRM should be notified of these 
 problems.</p>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Administrative Document Scanning</p>

<p class="whs4">An image and scanned document index 
 has been added to distinguish Administrative Chart documents/images from 
 Clinical Chart documents/images.</p>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Traditionally, there have been 
 two patient charts: the clinical and the administrative.</p>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">The clinical chart is traditionally 
 located on the ward or clinic when the patient is being seen.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">It is used 
 for patient care, and clinicians write notes, place orders and review 
 patient records in the clinical chart.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">The administrative chart generally 
 houses administrative documents related to the patient.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">These include 
 patient correspondence, eligibility documents, financial worksheets, inventory 
 of patient property, request for information, reports of contact and patient 
 rights and responsibilities forms.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">These two major chart categories, 
 Administrative and Clinical, are the top-level index for scanned documents.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">A security 
 key is required for viewing administrative documents.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">The document 
 type forms the second level index.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">When Administrative 
 documents are scanned, the user now selects the document type from a standard, 
 defined list of twenty-three types.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Automatic Means Test Transmission</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs4">Added the capacity to automatically 
 copy scanned Means Test images to a network location provided by the Health 
 Eligibility Center (HEC).</p>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">When a scanned document is indexed 
 as a Means Test document,</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">the image is 
 automatically flagged for transmission to the HEC.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">After transmission, 
 the associated patient’s record is updated to reflect that the Means Test 
 form has been transmitted.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Viewing Full Resolution Radiology 
 Images</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs4">The capability to display full 
 resolution images has been added to the Radiology Viewer.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs4">Full resolution 
 images, when available, can be displayed by clicking the &quot;Full Res&quot; 
 option in the Radiology Viewer’s menu bar.</p></li>
</ul>
