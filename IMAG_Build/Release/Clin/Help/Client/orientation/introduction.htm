<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Functional Description</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">The VistA Imaging System is an 
 extension to the <span style="font-weight: bold;

								color: #0000ff;"><font size=3 color=blue style="font-size:12.000000pt;"><I><B>Veterans Health Information 
 System Technology Architecture (VistA)</B></I></font></span> hospital information system 
 that captures clinical images, scanned documents, electrocardiogram (EKG) 
 waveforms, radiology images and other non-textual data files and makes 
 them part of the patient's electronic medical record. Image and text data 
 are provided in an integrated manner that facilitates the clinician's 
 task of correlating the data and making patient care decisions in a timely 
 and accurate way.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The system is designed to provide 
 the treating physician with a complete view of patient data and, at the 
 same time, allow consulting physicians to have access to the image and 
 text data. &nbsp;It 
 serves as a tool to aid communication and consultation among physicians 
 -- whether in the same department, in different medical services, or at 
 different sites.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The VistA Imaging System is unique 
 in that management of the medical images is an integral part of a hospital 
 information system. Imaging workstations located throughout the hospital 
 capture and display a wide variety of medical images including: cardiology, 
 bronchoscopy, GI endoscopy, hematology, surgical pathology, surgery, dermatology, 
 and radiology images.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The VistA Imaging System can be 
 used to capture many types of images associated with a wide variety of 
 procedures and examinations. The Imaging System has been extremely helpful 
 to a number of services. Some use the imaging workstation during every 
 case, others use it for selective cases. It serves five important purposes: 
 documents findings, makes images accessible to clinicians within the hospital, 
 assists in conference decision making and education, aids in follow-up 
 treatment of patients and facilitates telemedicine.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">In general, between three and ten 
 images are collected per procedure. &nbsp;Some 
 procedures lend themselves to predefinition of standard views to be recorded. 
 In other cases, images are recorded to document abnormal or unusual findings.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Many lesions are difficult to describe 
 in words, because terminology is not standard, and detailed description 
 requires time and is subjective. For example, there are many kinds of 
 ulcers. &nbsp;An 
 image provides a more accurate representation of the kind of ulcer, including 
 its size, appearance and relationship to surrounding structures. Even 
 quantitative estimates such as 75-90% occlusion of a vessel do not convey 
 the urgency of the situation as well as the image does.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Once images are captured, they 
 are accessible within the medical center, at Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), 
 and other sites at all times. Traditional methods of storage such as video 
 tape, 35 mm film, or glass slides require access to tape storage areas 
 and viewing devices. Erased or missing tapes are a common problem. &nbsp;In 
 addition to the setup time, video tape or film storage media requires 
 more physician time to locate the pathology for a particular patient. 
 Captured images are associated with the text report of the procedure and 
 are stored on the network for distribution throughout the institution. 
 Images are available immediately after collection to pathologists, surgeons, 
 radiologists and primary care physicians. Requests for assistance in viewing 
 cases may be decreased, although interest in the images has been seen 
 to increase.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Many images are routinely reviewed 
 during weekly conferences. At that time, pathology, radiology and other 
 images are generally available also. The entire group can go over all 
 the images where everyone can see where the lesions are. Often decisions 
 are made that could not otherwise be made. In some cases, the patient 
 may be saved from a repeat procedure in the operating room.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Finally, the captured images are 
 extremely helpful in follow-up care. Lesions that are being followed over 
 time can be compared directly. If another physician performs the follow-up 
 procedure, he or she has the benefit of the exact view which was seen 
 previously. The effects of treatment can be examined objectively.</p>
