<h1>VA Seal</h1>

<p class="whs1"><img src="../images/image392.gif" width="159px" height="160px" border="0" class="img_whs2"></p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The official seal includes an American 
 eagle clutching a cord in its talons. The cord binds a 13-star U.S. flag 
 and a 50-star U.S. flag. In the field over the eagle is a pentagon formation 
 of stars, with one point down. The words Department of Veterans Affairs 
 and United States of America surround the eagle, stars, and flags. A rope 
 motif makes up the outermost ring of the seal.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The eagle represents the eternal 
 vigilance of all our nation's veterans. The stars represent the five branches 
 of military service. The crossed flags represent our nation's history. 
 The gold cord that binds the two flags, which is shown clutched in the 
 eagle's talons is symbolic of those who have fallen in the defense of 
 liberty. Each of the various individual items placed together in the seal 
 is a salute to the past, present, and future.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The colors used in the configuration 
 are gold, brown, blue, white, silver, yellow, black, and red.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The colors are derived from the 
 American flag and from nature. By invoking this symbolism, the color scheme 
 represents the Nation's commitment to its veterans.</p>
