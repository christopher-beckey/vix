<h4>Vista imaging Display</h4>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p class="whs1">Patch 45 introduces the ability 
 to view patient images that were acquired and stored at a remote medical 
 facility. &nbsp;The 
 VistA Imaging Display workstation will continue to operate as before, 
 except for the ability to view remote images. &nbsp;An 
 indicator will be provided in the Abstract window to notify the user that 
 a remote image study is available. The image study will also be listed 
 in the Image List window. &nbsp;Interactions 
 with the images are unchanged from prior patches. &nbsp;Users 
 may prefer to interact with the Image List window while browsing remote 
 image studies because of the ability to filter and sort studies to find 
 studies of interest rapidly.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The few changes to the user interface 
 and the configuration settings are described below.</p>
