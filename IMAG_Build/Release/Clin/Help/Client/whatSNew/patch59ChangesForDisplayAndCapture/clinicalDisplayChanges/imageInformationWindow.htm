<h1>Image Information Window</h1>

<p class="whs1">The Image Information window now 
 reports the time relationship between the attachment of an image and the 
 status of the image’s associated progress note.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">For <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>signed</B></span> 
 or electronically filed (see note 1) progress notes, one of the following 
 lines may be displayed:</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Image was attached Same Day as 
 Note was Signed (see note 2)</p>

<p class="whs2">Image was attached Same Day as 
 Note was Electronically Filed (see note 2)</p>

<p class="whs2">Image was attached After the Note 
 was Signed</p>

<p class="whs2">Image was attached After Note was 
 Electronically Filed</p>

<p class="whs2">Image was attached Before the Note 
 was Signed</p>

<p class="whs2">Image was attached Before Note 
 was Electronically Filed</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">For <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>unsigned</B></span> 
 progress notes, the following is displayed:</p>

<p class="whs2">Image is attached to an Unsigned 
 Note</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">For notes with addenda (see note 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>3</B></span>), the following is displayed:</p>

<p class="whs2">Image is attached to an Addendum</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Notes:</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>1.</B></span> 
 The “electronically filed” status replaces the “administrative closure: 
 scanned document” status. This change is described in more detail in the 
 Sign or Electronically File Progress Notes section.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>2.</B></span> 
 If the time of the event is not specified when the image captured, but 
 if the dates of the note and image, when compared, are equal, then Image 
 was attached Same Day as... &nbsp;will 
 be displayed.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>3.</B></span> 
 An “addendum” is a new, optional way to attach more images to a note after 
 the note has been signed. Addenda are described more detail in the New 
 “Make Addendum” Option for Progress Notes section.</p>
