<h1>Viewing high resolution images</h1>

<p class="whs1">Generally, VISTA Imaging provides 
 reduced resolution digital x-rays at the clinical workstation to allow 
 rapid display for clinical review. These are labeled &quot;Reduced resolution, 
 reference quality image&quot; in the Description Bar and in the Title 
 Caption for the Radiology Viewer Window. Sometimes only the spatial resolution 
 is reduced (x, y directions), sometimes the grayscale range is reduced 
 to 8-bits &nbsp;If 
 a full resolution image is available, the FullRes Menu Option will appear 
 on the window.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">When a full diagnostic resolution 
 x-ray image is needed, the user may click on the FullRes menu option at 
 the top of the window. &nbsp;When 
 this option is selected, the image from the selected window (with yellow 
 caption beneath) will be redisplayed in full resolution. The 'Reduced 
 resolution...' Warning in the Description Bar and Window Title will disappear. 
 The image may be manipulated just like any other image.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">In some cases, there is no full 
 resolution available. In these cases, the user will see a message saying 
 'No Full Resolution Image Available.' This will typically happen if a 
 commercial PACS is being used at the site. In this case, full resolution 
 diagnostic images must be viewed on a PACS workstation. It will also happen 
 for CT, MR and other images that are ordinarily displayed in full resolution.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">If a full resolution image has 
 been displayed and the user pages to the next or the previous image, a 
 full resolution image will be displayed if it is available. If it is not 
 available, a reduced resolution image will be displayed; it will appear 
 to be a smaller image.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">When a full resolution image has 
 been displayed, the label 'Reduced size, reference quality image' will 
 be removed from the caption below that image. If there is more than one 
 image being displayed and another image is of reduced size, then the 'Reduced 
 size...' label will continue to appear in the window title at the top 
 of the window. Otherwise it will be removed from the window title.</p>
