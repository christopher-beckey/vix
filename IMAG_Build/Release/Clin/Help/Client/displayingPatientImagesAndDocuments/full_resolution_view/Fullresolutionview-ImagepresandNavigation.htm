<h1>Full Resolution View - image presentation &amp; navigation</h1>

<p class="whs1">The Full Resolution View window 
 opens automatically the first time an image is opened from the Abstracts 
 or Image Listing windows. The first displayed image is always shown in 
 the upper left corner of the display area. Depending on the default layout, 
 the image may occupy part or all of the display area.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><img src="../../images/display-fullResolutionViewMenu.jpg" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="600px" height="479px" border="0" class="img_whs2"></p>

<p class="whs1">Right-clicking the image causes 
 an options menu to be displayed.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">If additional images are opened 
 into the Full Resolution viewer, they are arranged from top to bottom, 
 then from left to right. The total number of images displayed at once 
 is dependent on the active layout.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">If there are more images loaded 
 than the current layout can accommodate, some images will be hidden but 
 are still available for display. Scrollbars located on the bottom and 
 right edges of the Full Resolution View window can be used to display 
 the additional images.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Unlike other viewers, images from 
 different procedures can be loaded and displayed in this window at the 
 same time. The labels included at the top of each image can be used to 
 identify which procedure the image is associated with.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The total number of loaded images 
 is always noted in a label on the left side, above the display area.</p>
