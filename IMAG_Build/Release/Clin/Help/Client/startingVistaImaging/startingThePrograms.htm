<h1>Starting the programs</h1>

<p class="whs1">To use VistA Imaging, the user 
 must have an access and verify code for the VistA Hospital Information 
 System. The user must also have the VistA Imaging menu option (MAG WINDOWS). 
 In order to capture images, the user must be assigned the appropriate 
 security key.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging Package will 
 appear on the workstation on the Start Menu under Programs on the desktop. 
 The package consists of two different user icons; one to display patient’s 
 multimedia medical records including images, and one to capture images.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Most clinical users will have access 
 to the display program. Access to the capture program is restricted to 
 those who perform procedures with image capture capability. In order to 
 activate a program, move the mouse until the cursor is over the icon for 
 the program, then click twice on the left mouse button. There will be 
 a pause and then a window should open; the VistA Imaging window or the 
 VistA logon window (depending on workstation setup). &nbsp;The 
 user should enter an access and verify code in the VistA logon window. 
 If the user has access privileges, the VistA logon window will disappear 
 and the user will be able to use VistA Imaging.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging Capture Program 
 is started by clicking on the capture icon under VistA Imaging Programs 
 on the Start Menu. To operate the capture program, the workstation must 
 be set up properly. This includes the correct installation of any hardware 
 interfaces and the proper configuring of initialization files to tell 
 the software about the type(s) of capture being performed. Further information 
 about capture setup is included in the Imaging installation manual.</p>

<p class="whs1">Users of VistA can access the On-Line 
 Help file by pressing the &lt;F1&gt; key while they are in a VistA Imaging 
 session.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">VistA Imaging can also be started 
 from the CPRS 'Tools' menu option, and act as an Image viewer for whatever 
 patient is opened in CPRS.</p>
