<h1>Summary Notes for Cardiology Users</h1>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System has been 
 extremely helpful in the cardiology laboratories. It is routinely used 
 during cardiac catheterization studies and echocardiography. It serves 
 four important purposes: provides documentation of findings, makes images 
 accessible to clinicians within the hospital, assists in conference decision 
 making and education, and aids in follow-up treatment of patients. A pre-defined 
 set of images are captured by a fellow or technologist, and these can 
 be quickly reviewed by supervisors and fellow staff.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Lesions are often difficult to 
 describe in words, because terminology is not standard, and detailed description 
 requires time and is subjective. Even rough quantification may not convey 
 the correct meaning or the sense of urgency which an image provides. For 
 example, a 75-90% occlusion describes a considerable range. An image provides 
 a more accurate representation of the lesion, including its size, appearance, 
 environment, and relationship to surrounding structures.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Once images are captured, they 
 are accessible within the medical center, at Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), 
 and other sites at all times. Traditional methods of storage such as 35mm 
 film or video tape require access to storage areas and specialized equipment. 
 &nbsp;Erased 
 or missing tapes and film are a common problem. In addition to the setup 
 time, these types of media require more physician time to locate the pathology 
 for a particular patient. Captured images are associated with the text 
 report of the procedure and are stored on the network for distribution 
 throughout the institution. Images are available immediately after collection 
 to surgeons and primary care physicians. Requests for assistance in viewing 
 cases are decreased.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Cardiology images can be routinely 
 reviewed during weekly conferences. At that time, surgery, pathology, 
 radiology, electrocardiogram and other images can generally be available 
 also. The entire group can go over all the images where everyone can see 
 where the lesions are. Often decisions can be made that could not otherwise 
 be made.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Finally, the captured images are 
 extremely helpful in follow-up care. Lesions that are being followed over 
 time can be compared directly. If another physician performs the follow-up 
 procedure, he or she has the benefit of the exact view which was seen 
 previously. The effects of treatment can be examined objectively.</p>
