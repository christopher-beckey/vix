<h1>Following Patient Treatment Progression</h1>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Introduction:</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">VistA Imaging can be used to capture 
 images that depict the progression of a medical or surgical procedure. 
 VistA Imaging can also be used to capture images during patient visits 
 to outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and in hospital wards. Various 
 hospital staff capture these images, including doctors, nurses and medical 
 technicians.</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Gathering Patient Images for a 
 Report</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">During treatment, hospital staff 
 can take digital photographs of wounds and append these photographs to 
 the patient's electronic record. &nbsp;These 
 images become part of the patient's permanent medical record.</p>

 or Medical Care Cost Recovery</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">In the past, documents such as 
 photographs, X-ray film, slides and photocopies have been inserted in 
 the file folders of patients. These documents are used by many medical 
 services and are not always available when required. VistA Imaging capabilities 
 make all of the patient's digital records available at any Clinical workstation.</p>
