<h1>Tabbing Sequence window</h1>

<p class="whs1">From the Main Capture window, select 
 the menu option 'Options| Field 'Tabbing' Sequence' to open this window.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The order that data is entered, 
 patient selected, procedure selected and image is captured can be defined 
 for the workstation. Usually the patient is selected first, but sometimes 
 as with Anatomic pathology, the patient isn't known until after the the 
 lab specimen is viewed and report has been selected from the Lab Package.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>To 
 change the order that the fields are displayed</I></span>, click on a field. 
 The left arrow shows which fields are currently selected. &nbsp;Click 
 on the Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow buttons to move the selected field.</p>

<p class="whs1"><img src="../../images/image132.jpg" width="446px" height="515px" border="0" class="img_whs2"></p>

<p class="whs1">Click 'OK' to save the changes 
 or 'Cancel' to discard any changes.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Check 'Save as Default' to save 
 this field order as the default for this workstation.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Note:</B></span> 
 In VistA Imaging the 'tabbing sequence' of the controls is always top 
 to bottom. When the control position is changed the tabbing sequence is 
 changed to reflect the new placement of controls.</p>
