<p class="whs1">Placing the Workstation:</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs2">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">The workstation 
 can be installed on a desk, modular shelving or mobile cart. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">The PC and 
 monitor should be connected to an electrical surge protection device. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">The entire 
 system should be physically secured to prevent loss (including prevention 
 of access to internal parts.)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">The workstation 
 should not be installed near heat sources, magnetic fields or liquids. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">The PC will 
 require periodic maintenance (i.e. removal of accumulated dust and dirt.)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">Imaging workstations 
 can also attach to accessories, such as scanners, video cameras and microscopes. 
 The workstation storage area should provide protection and support for 
 these accessories.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The imaging support staff should 
 meet with the medical staff who will be using the workstation to determine 
 the best location for the workstation.</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs2">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">Many issues 
 should be considered before selecting a location.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">Issues such 
 as mobility of the workstation and its distance from other equipment.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Locating an imaging workstation 
 can be a challenge, especially when a workstation is in an operating room 
 or other location that provides acute care.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The basic imaging workstation usually 
 consists of :</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs2">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">A PC running 
 the Windows NT or Windows 2000 operating system.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">The monitor 
 screen should be at least 17 diagonal inches and capable of displaying 
 the resolution required for image display. The minimum resolution should 
 be 1024 x 768 pixels with 16 million colors. &nbsp;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs1">All Windows 
 workstations use a mouse, track ball, or digital pad to allow users to 
 issue commands and navigate through applications.</p></li>
</ul>
