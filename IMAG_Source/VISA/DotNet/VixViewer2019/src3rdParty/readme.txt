README FILE FOR THE src3rdparty FOLDER

NancyFX
Nancy.zip is the download from github (version 1.4.4) as-is before being customized in the Nancy folder.
Per our standard, search for the word "customized" (without quotes) in file contents and file names.
NancyFX 2.0 is available (although obsolete) and requires many changes that need analysis before implementing.
