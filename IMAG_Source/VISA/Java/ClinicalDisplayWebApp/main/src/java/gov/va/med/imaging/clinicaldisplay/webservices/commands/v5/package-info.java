/**
 * Classes in this package are command implementations for version 5 clinical Display.  These commands might
 * not actually be used in the VIX but are created as a proof of concept that the command pattern will work in 
 * the future for Clinical Display interfaces.
 * 
 *  When Clinical Display version 6 is created, it will use the command pattern and implement new commands similar
 *  to those in v5 (using v6 interface types)
