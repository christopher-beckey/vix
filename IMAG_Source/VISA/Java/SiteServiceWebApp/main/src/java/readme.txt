This web application does not actually contain any code.  It simply provides an interface for using the SiteServiceSOAPServer and ExchangeSiteServiceSOAPServer code as a webservice.

The web service implementations are created in each respective project.

This file is used as a place holder so the main/src/java folder can have some contents which will ensure these folders are created when checking out from CVS.
