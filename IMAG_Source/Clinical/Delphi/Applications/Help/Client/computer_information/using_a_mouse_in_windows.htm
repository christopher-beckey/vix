<h1>Using a mouse in Windows</h1>

<p class="whs1">The following section describes 
 use of a two-button mouse with the Windows operating system. People with 
 experience in using the Windows operating system may elect not to read 
 this section. The term 'control' refers to buttons, menus, pull-down lists, 
 radio buttons, text-entry boxes and other elements of a window.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Mouse 
 button click</B></span>: A mouse is a device used to point at positions on 
 the screen. &nbsp;It 
 may have one, two or three buttons. It should be held by the end without 
 a cord so the fingers can press the buttons. The buttons are referred 
 to as the 'Right Mouse Button', the &quot;Left Mouse Button&quot;, and 
 the 'Center Mouse Button'. When the mouse is rolled around on a flat surface, 
 the arrow cursor on the screen will move correspondingly. Pressing and 
 releasing a button is called 'clicking'. Position the arrow over a portion 
 of the window, such as a button or scroll bar, and then click. This will 
 cause the computer to do something such as display an image, depending 
 on the window. When the instructions state to 'press the mouse button,' 
 the instructions are referring to the left mouse button.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Double-click:</B></span> 
 In many cases, clicking the mouse over an object in a VistA Imaging window 
 will select the object, but will not perform the command assigned to that 
 object. In these cases, double-click the object by clicking the left mouse 
 button over the object twice in quick succession. For example, when the 
 mouse pointer is clicked over an exam in the Radiology Exam Listing window, 
 Imaging will select the exam, but will not display the image or image 
 group associated with that exam. To see the image or image groups, double-click 
 the mouse pointer over the exam associated with the image or image group 
 that is desired.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Select:</B></span> 
 A rectangular area may be selected on the window. Position the arrow cursor 
 so it is over the left upper corner of the area to be selected. Press 
 the left mouse button down and hold it down while moving the mouse to 
 the right lower corner of the rectangle to be selected. Release the mouse 
 button. &nbsp;A 
 dotted rectangle will appear on the window around the area selected.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Right-click:</B></span> 
 Most of the windows in VistA Imaging have shortcut menus, such as the 
 Image Listing window, that can be seen by clicking the right mouse button 
 with the mouse pointer somewhere over the window. Use the arrow buttons 
 to highlight an option on the shortcut menu, and press the &lt;Enter&gt; 
 key to select the option.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Drag:</B></span> 
 To move a window to another area of the screen, for example, to see something 
 on a window that is underneath, position the cursor over the top colored 
 title area of the window to be moved. Press the left mouse button down 
 and move the mouse until the window is in the desired location. Release 
 the mouse button. This is called 'dragging' a window.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Drop-down 
 menu:</B></span> These are menus that display when a user clicks the mouse 
 pointer over a menu name.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Cursor:</B></span> 
 Also called a 'mouse pointer,' this is the graphic that moves along the 
 desktop in response to movement of the mouse along the mouse pad or by 
 typing on the keyboard. &nbsp;The 
 cursor changes appearance depending on what commands the user can issue 
 at the cursor's position on the desktop, e.g., the cursor looks like an 
 arrow over menus, like a flashing vertical bar over word-processing fields, 
 etc.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Shortcut 
 keys:</B></span> These are single keys or keystrokes that allow users to issue 
 commands from the keyboard that would otherwise require navigation through 
 menus. Many shortcut keys are combinations of keys, e.g., &lt;Alt-F4&gt; 
 refers to holding down one of the &lt;Alt&gt; keys and pressing the &lt;F4&gt; 
 key.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Clipboard:</B></span> 
 A memory buffer that allows users to cut, copy and paste data and objects 
 among Windows programs.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>&lt;|&gt;</B></span> 
 The size of the window may be adjusted by first placing the mouse at the 
 edge of the window to be moved. When the cursor turns into a double ended 
 arrow &lt;|&gt;, hold the left mouse button down and move the mouse until 
 the image is the width and/or height desired. &nbsp;Release 
 the left mouse button.</p>
