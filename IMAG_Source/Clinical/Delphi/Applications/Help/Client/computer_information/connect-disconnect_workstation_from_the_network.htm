<h1>Connect-Disconnect workstation from the network</h1>

<p class="whs1">There are two types of mobile workstations: 
 medical mobile stations and stations used for support personnel or for 
 presentations. All mobile stations will need to be connected and disconnected 
 from a power source and from the Ethernet network.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Medical mobile stations are usually 
 used by a medical group for similar medical functions. &nbsp;Those 
 functions can occur at several locations within a medical center. Medical 
 workstations are configured to receive either video or RGB input from 
 medical equipment and include both the Imaging PC system and additional 
 hardware required to translate signals among formats, e.g., RGB to video. 
 The user needs to connect and disconnect the workstation from the source 
 of the signal. These connections usually have four wires: Red, Green, 
 Blue, and Sync (Synchronization).</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Stations used for support personnel 
 or for presentations are equipped with the Imaging PC system and various 
 devices that connect to medical equipment and image projectors, such as 
 LCD overhead projection displays. These stations include accessories to 
 translate the image output from the imaging PC to various display media. 
 The user needs to connect and disconnect the Imaging PC to the projection 
 media. The user may also need to connect a conversion unit between the 
 Imaging PC and the projection media to translate the signal from the Imaging 
 PC into a format that the projection media can interpret.</p>
