<h1>Summary Notes for Surgery Users</h1>

<p class="whs1">One of the most common reasons 
 to photograph abnormal findings in a teaching institution is for subject 
 related lectures and discussions with medical students and residents. 
 &nbsp;Another 
 need is to better document the physical examination for medical documentation 
 purposes, which more effectively allows physicians who have not examined 
 a patient before to appreciate subtle (but potentially important changes 
 from a prior clinic visit. &nbsp;For 
 several years in head and neck cancer clinics, I have recorded post operative/post 
 radiation oral and laryngeal examinations on videotape for this purpose 
 and it has helped to detect earlier recurrent disease. &nbsp;However, 
 storage and retrieval of those tapes is a real challenge. &nbsp;The 
 imaging workstation now makes such information almost immediately available 
 throughout the hospital (and other sites), including the operating room 
 where a quick comparison between the intra-operative evaluation and the 
 clinic exam can at times be helpful. &nbsp;Microscope 
 exams of ears and eyes, ulcers in vascular or podiatry clinic, and GI 
 endoscopy are a sampling of other uses.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Routinely now, we discuss cases 
 in the Multi-Disciplinary Tumor conference with projected images stored 
 on the VistA system. &nbsp;(We 
 no longer use a 35 mm projector.) &nbsp;We 
 commonly project pertinent pictures of GI endoscopy, bronchoscopy, clinic 
 exams, radiographs, etc. combined with intra-operative pictures, and histology.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Communication between the operating 
 room and the pathologist has notably improved, especially in discussing 
 frozen section examinations of specimen margins in complex cases.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">During surgery, a series of images 
 are captured showing the removal of a specimen with orienting anatomical 
 details visible. &nbsp;Then 
 the removed specimen is placed on a towel or paper. &nbsp;Where 
 possible this is in the same orientation and near the site of removal 
 to better orient the pathologist, and for such complex things as a Mohs 
 technique frozen section, both the patient and specimen are marked with 
 ink and photographed together. &nbsp;The 
 operating rooms are linked with intercoms and when the pathologist receives 
 the specimen and views the VistA images, subtle questions and answers 
 are passed back and forth from one team to the other. &nbsp;Interesting 
 pathology can immediately be captured and &quot;fed back&quot; to the 
 operating room.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Recently one of our staff captured 
 a series of teaching slides from a very unusual case into the VistA Imaging 
 System. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our 
 Medical Media Service had 35 mm slides, generated directly from those 
 VistA images ready for him in order to discuss the case at the adjoining 
 university hospital as he left the building that evening.</p>
