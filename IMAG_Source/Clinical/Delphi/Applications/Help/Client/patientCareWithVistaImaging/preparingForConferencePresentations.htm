<h1>Preparing for conference presentations</h1>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Introduction:</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">A major use of VistA Imaging is 
 for patient presentations during conferences.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Capture of Images for a Conference</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">If the images to be shown are not 
 already in the system, they should be captured from their storage media 
 (e.g., microscope slides, videotapes, photographs, films). &nbsp;Please 
 refer to the instructions for capturing images. The image description 
 field can be used for any notes specific to the image. Be sure to link 
 the images to their corresponding procedure or report. The VistA Imaging 
 developers recommend that written notes are made of the patient identifications 
 and images for the conference.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Testing Display Workstation Before 
 Conference</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">Before the conference, a member 
 of the conference team should check the workstation in the conference 
 room to make sure that everything is working properly. During the test, 
 view the images that are planned to be used during the presentation to 
 make sure that there are no unexpected workstation, projector, server, 
 or VistA problems. Viewing the images will also cause VistA Imaging to 
 move jukebox images to magnetic storage for more rapid display during 
 the presentation. If a problem is encountered during the test, notify 
 the system manager immediately.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Creating Slides From Online Images</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">Recently one of our staff captured 
 a series of teaching slides from a very unusual case into the VistA Imaging 
 System. Our Medical Media Service had 35 mm slides, generated directly 
 from those VistA images ready for him in order to discuss the case at 
 the adjoining university hospital as he left the building that evening.</p>
