<h1>Summary Notes for Radiology Users</h1>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System provides 
 a number of benefits to the radiology service. Clinicians often want to 
 view films, even before radiological interpretation has been completed. 
 &nbsp;There are 
 often difficulties with films being borrowed, and then being unavailable 
 for interpretation in the radiology department. The VistA Imaging System 
 allows direct interface to systems such as PACS (Picture Archiving and 
 Communications Systems) or non-proprietary radiology subnetworks for direct 
 acquisition of digital images. Use of an x-ray laser scanner for film 
 digitization is also supported. Imaging System workstations allow modification 
 of the contrast (window) and brightness (level) of the radiology image. 
 This has been found to provide advantages in some cases in interpreting 
 films.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System handles 
 images from a variety of medical specialties. In some cases, it is helpful 
 to view the pathology or the surgical view, either during the diagnostic 
 process or to confirm impressions for difficult cases. The Imaging System 
 is commonly used during conferences. Several sites have plans to use Multimedia 
 Mail for educational purposes across sites.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Higher resolution, 2k x 2k display 
 monitors have been integrated with the VistA Imaging workstation to allow 
 filmless diagnostic interpretation of images. These meet the standards 
 for teleradiology diagnosis. &nbsp;This 
 is extremely cost-effective when compared to commercial workstations costing 
 many times this price.</p>
