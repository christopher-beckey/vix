<h1>Summary Notes for GI Users</h1>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System has been 
 extremely helpful in the gastroendoscopy laboratory. It is routinely used 
 during upper endoscopies, colonoscopies, and flexible sigmoidoscopies. 
 It serves four important purposes: &nbsp;documents 
 findings, makes images accessible to clinicians within the hospital, assists 
 in conference decision making and education, and aids in follow-up treatment 
 of patients. &nbsp;The 
 Imaging workstation is a part of every GI endoscopy procedure. Approximately 
 one third of procedures are abnormal, and approximately three images are 
 captured during these procedures. Images are generally not captured during 
 normal examinations.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Once images are captured, they 
 are accessible within the medical center, at Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), 
 and other sites at all times. Traditional methods of storage, such as 
 videotape, require access to tape storage areas and players. Erased or 
 missing tapes are a common problem. &nbsp;In 
 addition to the setup time, video tape storage media requires more physician 
 time to locate the pathology for a particular patient.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Captured images are associated 
 with the text report of the procedure and are stored on the network for 
 distribution throughout the institution &nbsp;Images 
 are available immediately after collection to pathologists, surgeons, 
 and primary care physicians. Requests for assistance in viewing cases 
 are decreased.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">GI lesions are often difficult 
 to describe in words, because terminology is not standard, and detailed 
 description requires time and is subjective. For example, there are many 
 kinds of ulcers. &nbsp;An 
 image provides a more accurate representation of the kind of ulcer, including 
 its size, appearance and relationship to surrounding structures.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">GI images are routinely reviewed 
 during weekly surgical conferences. At that time, pathology, radiology 
 and other images are generally available also. The entire group can go 
 over all the images so everyone can see where the lesions are. Often decisions 
 are made that could not otherwise be made. In many cases, the patient 
 is saved from a repeat endoscopy in the operating room.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Finally, the captured images are 
 extremely helpful in follow-up care. &nbsp;Lesions 
 that are being followed over time can be compared directly. &nbsp;If 
 another physician performs the follow-up procedure, he or she has the 
 benefit of the exact view which was seen previously. &nbsp;The 
 effects of treatment can be examined objectively.</p>
