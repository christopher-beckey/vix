<h1>Summary Notes for General Medical Procedures Users</h1>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System has been 
 extremely helpful to a number of services. Some use the Imaging workstation 
 during every case, others use it for selective cases. It serves four important 
 purposes: documents findings, makes images accessible to clinicians within 
 the hospital, assists in conference decision making and education, and 
 aids in follow-up treatment of patients.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">A variety of medical specialties 
 can be selected under medical procedures. These can be used for a a wide 
 variety of procedures that do not have a specific Medicine package module. 
 The user can then use the Medicine package to create a report containing 
 the procedure name, summary of results, indications, assessment and plan.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">In general, between three and ten 
 images are collected per procedure. Some procedures lend themselves to 
 pre-definition of standard views to be recorded. In other cases, images 
 are recorded to document abnormal or unusual findings.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Many lesions are difficult to describe 
 in words, because terminology is not standard, and detailed description 
 requires time and is subjective. For example, there are many kinds of 
 ulcers. An image provides a more accurate representation of the kind of 
 ulcer, including its size, appearance and relationship to surrounding 
 structures. Even quantitative estimates such as 75-90% occlusion of a 
 vessel do not convey the urgency of the situation as well as the image 
 does.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Once images are captured, they 
 are accessible within the medical center, at Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), 
 and other sites at all times. Traditional methods of storage such as video 
 tape, 35 mm film, or glass slides require access to tape storage areas 
 and viewing devices. &nbsp;Erased 
 or missing tapes are a common problem. In addition to the setup time, 
 video tape or film storage media requires more physician time to locate 
 the pathology for a particular patient. Captured images are associated 
 with the text report of the procedure and are stored on the network for 
 distribution throughout the institution. Images are available immediately 
 after collection to pathologists, surgeons, radiologists and primary care 
 physicians. Requests for assistance in viewing cases may be decreased, 
 although interest in the images has been seen to increase.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Many images are routinely reviewed 
 during weekly conferences. At that time, pathology, radiology and other 
 images are generally available also. The entire group can go over all 
 the images where everyone can see where the lesions are. Often decisions 
 are made that could not otherwise be made. In some cases, the patient 
 may be saved from a repeat procedure in the operating room.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Finally, the captured images are 
 extremely helpful in follow-up care. Lesions that are being followed over 
 time can be compared directly. If another physician performs the follow-up 
 procedure, he or she has the benefit of the exact view which was seen 
 previously. The effects of treatment can be examined objectively.</p>
