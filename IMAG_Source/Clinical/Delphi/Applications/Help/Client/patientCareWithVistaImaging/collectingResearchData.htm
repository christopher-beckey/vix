<h1>Collecting research data</h1>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Introduction:</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">Medical research is conducted on 
 an ongoing basis at all medical centers. Researchers are often faced with 
 the need to store text as well as images in order to document the stages 
 of their studies. Storing and retrieving large amounts of visual data 
 are tasks well suited to computerization.</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Collecting Images</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">Most of the medical equipment used 
 by patient care providers are capable of producing digital images. Those 
 units that are not able to produce a direct digital image usually provide 
 a video display. VistA Imaging equipment can be configured to attach to 
 these medical systems and provide a means to save images in patient files. 
 Other systems can provide these images as well. Some examples of these 
 systems are still and motion video cameras and black and white or color 
 scanners. VistA Imaging allows users to add descriptive text to the images 
 while they are being saved.</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Organizing Data</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">VistA Imaging can be used to sort 
 the images collected and arrange a set of image copies in whatever order 
 that may be desired.</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Presenting Research</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">VistA Imaging can be used to export 
 images to commercial off-the-shelf software. The file formats of the exported 
 files are in common, standard formats. Commercial software can then be 
 used to add the images to desktop presentation software.</p>
