<h1>Summary Notes for Pathology Users</h1>

<p class="whs1">Protocols can be agreed upon with 
 surgeons to provide more useful treatment information. For example, during 
 surgery, a series of images are captured showing the removal of a specimen 
 with orienting anatomical details visible. Then the removed specimen is 
 placed on a towel or paper. &nbsp;Where 
 possible this is in the same orientation and near the site of removal 
 to better orient the pathologist, and for such complex things as a Mohs 
 technique frozen section, both the patient and specimen are marked with 
 ink and photographed together. &nbsp;The 
 operating rooms are linked with intercoms and when the pathologist receives 
 the specimen and views the VistA images, subtle questions and answers 
 are passed back and forth from one team to the other. Interesting pathology 
 can immediately be captured and &quot;fed back&quot; to the operating 
 room.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System is an 
 important tool for managing digitized images in anatomic pathology. &nbsp;The 
 Imaging system can be used to archive pathology images for distribution 
 around the institution for professional and student education. Because 
 of the large number of individual images present in a single glass slide, 
 it is not cost-effective to replace an entire glass slide with a set of 
 images. Rather, the anatomic pathologist should select individual views 
 from a slide of interest, in order to demonstrate the diagnostic or other 
 interesting features in a slide. With a properly installed interface between 
 the microscope and the VistA Imaging System camera, suitable lighting, 
 and good optics in the microscope, diagnostic-quality images can be captured. 
 &nbsp;However, 
 since all the images on a slide cannot be captured cost-effectively, the 
 slide must be kept as a reference. &nbsp;The 
 captured image has the advantage that it does not fade over time.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Once the desired images have been 
 captured by the anatomic pathologist, they are immediately appended to 
 the patient's electronic record, and may be viewed by any person in the 
 institution (and other sites) with an Imaging workstation and access to 
 that patient's record. This includes all the workstations within the anatomic 
 pathology department (other attending pathologists, resident's room); 
 all the clinical services with workstations (operating room, medicine, 
 surgery, endoscopy, dermatology, bronchoscopy); and the institution's 
 auditorium, where interdepartmental conferences are held.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">The VistA Imaging System has been 
 extremely helpful to the clinical services and is routinely used during 
 endoscopies, cardiology procedures, and surgical procedures. It serves 
 four important purposes: documents procedures, makes images accessible 
 to clinicians within the hospital, assists in conference decision making 
 and education, and aids in follow-up treatment of patients. </p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Pathology images are routinely 
 reviewed during weekly tumor board conferences. At that time, pathology, 
 surgery, endoscopy, radiology and other images are generally available 
 also. The entire group can go over all the images so everyone can see 
 where the lesions are.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">It has been found that having images 
 available on the system has increased the resident and staff interest 
 in pathology and has improved communications.</p>
