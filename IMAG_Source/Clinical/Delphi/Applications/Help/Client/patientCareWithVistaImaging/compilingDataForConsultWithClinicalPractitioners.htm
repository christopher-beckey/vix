<h1>Compiling data for consult with clinical practitioners</h1>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Introduction:</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">Medical images are often used by 
 clinical practitioners as well as medical specialists. VistA Imaging enables 
 users to compile images into presentations that clinical practitioners 
 can use to make decisions about patient care.</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Documenting a Patient's Condition 
 During a Clinic Visit</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">The clinician can use imaging equipment 
 (such as a video camera) to enhance a description of a medical condition. 
 The images can serve as a basis for further treatment. A comparison of 
 previous images to later results can reveal the progression of treatment.</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Appending Imaging Data</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">Each specialist that treats the 
 patient can append their visual data to the patient's medical record. 
 Each patient care provider can then track the record of the medical condition 
 using the data accumulated by their predecessors.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; "><B>Conferences Between Clinicians 
 and Specialists</B></SPAN></p>

<p class="whs2">In live conferences or teleconferences, 
 several clinicians and specialists can view patient images. This data 
 can be shared by medical staff at any VA medical center with staff at 
 other centers by granting them remote access to the VistA files.</p>
