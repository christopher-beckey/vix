<h4>vista imaging - clinical display</h4>

<h1>Patch 72 Overview</h1>

<p>Patch 72 upgrades the imaging component used within the Clinical Display 
 client to AccuSoft ImageGear 15.4 (currently).</p>

<ul type="square" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>This component is now used throughout the application 
 for viewing of all images.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>By using this new component we have fixed several 
 problems we had with the previous version of AccuSoft ImageGear (IG99) 
 including:</p></li>
	
	<ul type="circle" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>the odd-columns problem and viewing embedded 
 thumbnails.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Included in this patch is a brand new Radiology Viewer that makes use 
 of some of the features available in this new image toolkit.</p>

<ul type="square" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>This new viewer is based on the functionality 
 of the old Radiology Viewer but has a look and feel that matches more 
 closely to the Full Resolution viewer.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The goal here is to make it easier for users to 
 access buttons and functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul type="square" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Also in this patch are new components needed to 
 communicate with the DOD and view DOD images.</p></li>
	
	<ul type="circle" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>These components allow images and studies 
 from the DOD to appear like VA sites.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>If a patient has been seen at the DOD, the 
 DOD site will appear on the Remote Image View toolbar in the same manner 
 as a VA site would.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p>Communication with the DOD is done through 
 the VistA Imaging Exchange (VIX) service (Patch 83).</p></li>
		
		<ul type="square" class="whs1">
			
			<li class=kadov-p><p>A site can only view DOD images if they 
 have a VIX installed.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
