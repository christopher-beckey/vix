Brief Clinical History:
43 YEAR OLD WHITE MALE WITH ULCERATIVE COLITIS FOR GREATER THAN
20 YEARS NOW FOR SURVEILLANCE
Preoperative Diagnosis:
ULCERATIVE COLITIS RULE OUT
NEOPLASM
Operative Findings:
POLYPOID MASS AT 65 CM 
Gross Description
The specimen is received in 9 formalin filled containers all 
labeled with The patients name.  The first container is 
additionally labeled No. 1 "P CEC."  This consists of a small 
tan, 0.2 X 0.2 cm fragment of tissue. This entirely submitted 
in an embedding bag in a single cassette labeled A.  The Second 
container is additionally No. 2 (90).  The specimen consists of 
a single 0.2 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm tan fragment of tissue.  This is 
entirely submitted in a single cassette labeled B.  The 3rd 
specimen is additionally labeled No. 3-80.  The specimen 
consists of a single fragment of tan tissue which measures
0.2 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm.  The specimen is entirely submitted within
an embedding bag in a single cassette labeled C.  The next
specimen is additionally labeled (4-65).  The specimen consists 
of multiple fragments of tan tissue which measure in aggregate 
approximately 1.0 X less than X 0.1 cm.  Each individual fragment
measures approximately 0.2 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm.  These are entirely 
submitted within an embedding bag in a single cassette labeled D.
The next container is additionally labeled No. (5-55).  This 
specimen consists of 2 small fragments of tissue which measure
0.4 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm in aggregate dimension.  These are entirely
submitted within an embedding bag in a single cassette labeled E. 
The next specimen is additionally labeled No. (6-45).  The specimen 
consists oF a single tan fragment of tissue which measures 0.4 X 0.2 
X 0.2 cm.    This is entirely submitted within an embedding bag in a
single cassette labeled F.  The next specimen is additionally labeled 
(7-35).  The specimen consists of 2 fragments of tan tissue which 
measure approximately 0.4 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm in aggregate dimension.
These are entirely submitted within a single cassette labeled G.
The next is additionally labeled (8-25).  The specimen consists of 
a single 0.1 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm fragment of tan tissue.  This entirely
submitted in a single cassette labeled H.  The next specimen is
additionally labeled (9-rectum).  The specimen consists of 2
small tan fragments of brown tissue which measure 0.1 X 0.1 X 0.2 cm
each.  These are entirely submitted within an embedding bag in a 
cassette labeled J.

DIAGNOSIS (Date Spec taken: JUL  3, 1991)
BIOPSY OF CECUM (A):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.
 
BIOPSY OF ASCENDING COLON AT 90CM (B):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
          WITH FOCAL LYMPHOID AGGREGATE.

BIOPSY HEPATIC FLEXURE AT 80 CM (C):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
          WITH FOCAL LYMPHOID AGGREGATE AND SLIGHT HYPERPLASIA 
          OF MUCOSA.

BIOPSY DISTALTRANSVERSE COLON AT 65 CM (D):  CHRONIC AND FOCAL
          ACUTE INFLAMMATION WITH FOCAL CRYPTITIS AND MUCOSAL
          REGENERATION.

          DISTORTION OF MUCOSAL PATTERN AND MUCOSAL HYPERPLASIA.

BIOPSY OF DESCENDING COLON AT 55 CM (E):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

BIOPSY OF DESCENDING COLON/SIGNOID AT 45 CM (F):  CHRONIC AND FOCAL
          ACUTE INFLAMMATION WITH FOCAL CRYPTITIS AND CRYPT ABSCESS 
          FORMATION.

BIOPSY OF SIGMOID COLON AT 35 CM (G):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

BIOPSY OF SIGMOID COLON AT 25 CM (H):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
          WITH FOCAL LYMPHOID AGGREGATE AND MILD DISTORTION OF
          GLANDULAR PATTERN.

BIOPSY OF RECTUM (J):  MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION WITH FOCAL LYMPHOID
          AGGREGATE.

COMMENTS:  THE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH ULCERATIVE COLITIS.
           CRYPTITIS OR CRYPT ABSCESS ARE PRESENT IN BIOPSIES FROM
           TRANSVERSE COLON AT 65CM AND DESCENDING COLON/SIGMOID AT
           45 CM.  THE BIOPSIES FROM 65 CM DO NOT SHOW DYSPLASIA
           OR NEOPLASIA IN THE MATERIAL SUBMITTED.
