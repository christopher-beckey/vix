Tasks

///////////////////////

Completed in Version 1.0
XX Change all references to group and element to unsigned short.  Cast the
initial long int to unsigned short located in ReadChgFile method in Reconstruct
class.

XX Do I need to load RTC? Determine best method to find the VR for each element.
RESP: Yes.  Configured it to do so.

XX Determine if VM accessibility is thru dicom.lib or iodbase.lib.
RESP: VM is accessible through iodbase.lib only.

XX Modify ReadChgFile to bypass field description in change file.

XX Add assignment operator to resolve error with TagLine class.

XX Change the prefix notation on class members and methods.

XX Need ability to open file based on full UNC pathnames.

XX Resolve memory leaks.

XX Make sure to delete objects in the class destructor.

XX Determine if/how to restart the DDO back to the initial position.
This is to make sure you step through all the tag in the messages.

XX Figure out the problem with the struct in the Exception class.

XX Figure out why new dicom file is not created and written to.

XX Ask Dee why "free" command did not work properly.

XX Add additional comments to code.

XX Verify program can handle all SOP Classes used by
the VA.

XX Check if Sequence before processing Tag. If so, generate error
and exit.

XX Determine how to decode the stored TypeCode in the VR.  It is
 stored as integer.  This is done by the Pack method.  Probably
  generate an UnPack method.

XX Redo how to find, maintain, and change, when desired, 
the syntax of the Data Set in the Meta file.  Remember, the Meta File
information (group 2) is always Explicit VR Little Endian.

XX Correct the store Meta File with the Data Set.  Currently,
it alters the Meta File Information (group 2) and leaves the Data Set
alone.  It is suppose to do the opposite.  The Meta File information
should never change.

XX Correct Group2 Length error.  The ucdavis code currently determines
the length before packing the buffer.  Bytes are added while packing
the buffer.

XX Add error correction to handle non-standard keyword.

XX Program crashes when processing Private elements.  Determine how
to correct this.  It might have crashed because the VR TypeCode was
not known.

XX It appears the program does not handle spaces in the value field 
in the text file.  It should.  Isolate problem and correct.

XX Make code handle both lowercase and uppercase keywords.  currently,
it can only handle uppercase.

XX Correct memory leak when reading change file.  To do with 
m_obTagLine object in ReadChgFile method.

XX Correct problems with building release version of executable.

XX Add code to compare input file against output file.  If same, error
out.

XX Add the exception code to the output string.


Completed in Version 1.3

XX Have Implementation UID/Name of the VA in the outgoing DICOM file.

XX Rename the data dictionary file from MAGD_dd.txt to MAGD_RECON.txt.

XX Corrected some memory leaks.

XX Check Transfer Syntax.

XX Accept and process JPEG Baseline images.

XX Modify CHANGE keyword functionality.  If Tag does not exist, do not error.  Perform an INSERT instead.

XX Tighten up file format checking to make sure only Explicit VR Little Endian files
are converted.

XX Update User Manual.

Completed in Version 1.4

XX Corrected problem handling DICOM messages with JPEG Baseline compression transfer
syntax.  The correction was in the DICOM toolkit, not mag_recon.exe.  Mag_recon.exe
now uses an updated version of the DICOM toolkit.

Completed in Version 1.5

XX Added ability to properly handle all images with all possible JPEG Transfer Syntaxes.  
Changes occurred in both the toolkit and the mag_recon.exe application.


Future Functionality:

__ Expand code to verify existance of file before attempting to
open same file.

__ Dee suggested creating a function containing a case statement 
to compare the VR and mulnipulate the data accordingly.

__ Add ability to modify Sequences.

__ Temporarily, skip validation of Type 1 elements.  DICOM toolkit must be
modified to handle Type 1 validation.  Add it after giving Peter initial exe
to start testing.

__ Change Tag.  Return error if new value exceeds max. length determined
by the VR typecode.

__ Generate new SOP Instance UID.  Copy the original SOP Instance UID
to Reference SOP Instance UID.  Let Peter know this is not DICOM
compliant, but close.  I cannot help it.
